## Command your Visca device through an ARDUINO over OSC

OSC-visca allows you to command your Visca device with open sound control messages.

The OSC-Visca project converts OSC message to serial command.
It's running on an arduino with ethernet connected to a local network and a TTL to serial converter connected to the Visca compliant camera.
You can send data from : 
*	an OSX application, to run on a computer. (done)
*	an Windows application, to run on a computer. (done)
*	a Max 6 patch, you can run it both on windows and osx. (done)
*	a pure-data patch, you can run it both on linux, windows and osx. (not even started)
*	a Lemur patch on your iPad
*	a touchOSC patch on your iPad
*	or from any application that can send OSC messages
